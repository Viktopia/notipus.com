# notipus.com

Notipus is a real-time customer intelligence platform that sends instant, contextual notifications to Slack about customer events from various services.

## Development

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the site locally:

```bash
# Start Tailwind CSS build in watch mode
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start the server:
docker-compose up
```

For production build:

```bash
# Build and minify CSS
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the master branch. The deployment process is handled by GitHub Actions and consists of two main jobs:

### Build Job
1. Sets up Node.js 20
2. Installs dependencies using `npm ci`
3. Builds the Tailwind CSS (`npm run build`)
4. Creates deployment directory with:
   - HTML files
   - Built CSS
   - Images
   - JavaScript files

### Deploy Job
1. Takes the built artifacts
2. Deploys to GitHub Pages
3. Updates the environment URL

You can view the deployment status and history in the Actions tab of the repository.
